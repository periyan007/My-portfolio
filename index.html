   <div class="item"><h3>Who I'm Now</h3><br>
   <h5> I work as a member of a key team in a top department in a top automotive manufacturing factory.</h5>
   <br>
   <h5>
I am currently working in R&D Department as Mechanical Maintenance Technician.</h5><br>
   <h5>
If we are all different from the other department then top management is meticulously monitoring the quality of our work.</h5>
<br>
<h5>All the machines I work with or repair are not only highly valued but also unique.</h5>
<br>
<h5>
The work I do at present is sometimes more complicated and more responsible. Now we oversee more than 65 high value machines. Its maintenance schedule is very important and even necessary.</h5>
<br>
<h5>
I have worked on and are doing some important projects here. The cost of doing those tests is high and we have less facilities to do it.  However we are still doing it
</h5>
   </h5></div>
   <div class="item"><h3>Who I'm After 5 Years</h3>
   <br>
   <h5>For the next 5 years I will be a web developer in a fashionable technology field.  And that is also my long day wish.  You can in no way associate this with the work I am currently doing Even me.This is an idea that sparked my curiosity throughout.</h5>
   <br>
   <h5>I would have been doing my job in the department where I now work as a better maintenance engineer with more responsibility.  Although it is a different factory (if I was working in Brakes India) it fits,</h5>
   <br>
   <h5>
     If not for the two May mentioned above I would have started a company for myself as an Entrepreneur and worked hard for its future plans.
   </h5></div>
  <div class="item"><h3>Those who are with me</h3>
  <br>
  <h5>My Attitude</h5> <br>
  <h5>My Knowledge</h5> <br>
  <h5>My Experience</h5> <br>
  <h5>My Lovely Job</h5> <br>
  <h5>My Family & Friends</h5> <br>
  <h5>Finally My Guardian Angel ðŸ˜‡</h5></div>
